# task_3

My name is Debneel Roy and this is day 3 of my SQL Developer Internship at Elevate Labs.

Today's task was to extract data from the tables created in the previous tasks.

I used the SELECT function with the WHERE clause and LIMIT clause.
I also used ORDER BY to sort the tables according to specific column(s) in ascending or descending order.

Thank You.
